# Transformer from Scratch

This project implements a Transformer model from scratch, based on the "Attention Is All You Need" paper. The current use case is an English to Italian translator, but it can be easily adapted to other language pairs through the configuration file.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a deep understanding of Transformer architecture by implementing it from scratch. The model is built using PyTorch and follows the architecture described in the seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al.

## Features

- Complete Transformer architecture implementation
- Customizable model parameters
- English to Italian translation (easily adaptable to other language pairs)
- Tokenization using WordLevel tokenizer
- Training pipeline with TensorBoard integration
- Configurable training parameters

## Project Structure

- `train.py`: Main training script
- `model.py`: Transformer model implementation
- `dataset.py`: Custom dataset and data loading utilities
- `config.py`: Configuration file for model and training parameters
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/transformer-from-scratch.git
cd transformer-from-scratch

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the required dataset (e.g., opus_books for English-Italian)

## Usage

To train the model, run:
python train.py

This will start the training process using the parameters specified in `config.py`.

## Configuration

You can customize various aspects of the model and training process by modifying the `config.py` file. Some key parameters include:

- `batch_size`: Number of samples per batch
- `num_epochs`: Number of training epochs
- `lr`: Learning rate
- `seq_len`: Maximum sequence length
- `d_model`: Dimension of the model
- `lang_src`: Source language code
- `lang_tgt`: Target language code

## Next Steps

The next major step for this project is to build a validation pipeline. This will involve:

1. Implementing a separate validation loop
2. Calculating validation loss and other relevant metrics
3. Integrating early stopping based on validation performance
4. Generating sample translations on the validation set
5. Implementing BLEU score calculation for quantitative evaluation

Other potential improvements and features to consider:

- Beam search for inference
- Fine-tuning options
- Support for multiple GPU training
- Web interface for easy translation demos
